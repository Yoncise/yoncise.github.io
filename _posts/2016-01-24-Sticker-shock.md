__They have their uses, but the burden visas impose on travellers and recipient countries is too high__

*[impose on]: 把…强加给

VISAS are necessary evils. They offer governments a way to control their borders, whether to regulate the flow of 
immigrants or to pick out threats to security. But the paperwork and fees they entail also deter legitimate tourists 
and business travellers. Researchers at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think-tank, reckon that eliminating all 
travel visas to the United States would add between $90 billion and $123 billion in annual tourist spending. By one 
estimate, introducing visa restrictions can lower trade and foreign direct investment between a pair of countries 
by as much as 25%.

*[visas]: 签证
*[necessary evils]: 不愿见其发生但又无法避免的事
*[regulate]: 调节
*[pick out]: 挑选出
*[paperwork]: 文书工作
*[entail]: 引起；使成为必要，使需要
*[deter]: 使打消念头
*[legitimate]: 合法的；正当的；
*[libertarian]: 自由的；自由论者的；
*[think-tank]: 智囊团
*[reckon]: 测算，估计；

The job of policymakers is to strike the right balance between such costs and benefits. On short-term business and 
tourist visas, they have failed. Take security. Visas, proponents say, keep countries safer by controlling who is 
able to enter. That is true, but they are not very efficient. Terrorists can be home-grown as well as foreign, 
qualify for visas (as the 9/11 attackers did) or slip across borders illegally. Imposing restrictions on the basis 
of nationality is the bluntest of instruments, scooping up legions of ordinary tourists and travellers as well as 
the occasional suspect. America’s decision to tighten the rules for anyone who has recently been to Iran, Iraq, 
Sudan and Syria will affect aid workers and plotters alike.

*[policymakers]: 决策者
*[proponents]: 支持者；建议者
*[nationality]: 国籍
*[bluntest]: 迟钝的
*[instruments]: 工具；
*[scooping up]: 兜接，舀上来
*[legions]: 大量，众多
*[aid]: 援助；
*[plotters]: 策划者，阴谋者
*[alike]: 类似的

It is a similar story with unauthorised migration. Identifying visitors who might overstay their welcome is a core
duty of visa officers. Western countries often require several months’ bank statements, pay slips, proof of financial 
and property holdings, tax returns and letters from bosses promising that their employees will return (see article). 
These strictures also put off legitimate travellers. When Canada lifted visa requirements for Czech citizens in 2007, 
the number of Czech tourists jumped by a third; when restrictions were reintroduced in 2009, after a rise in asylum 
applications, arrivals fell by 70% over three years. Rather than gumming up all travel, it made more sense to process 
asylum claims faster. The rules have subsequently been relaxed again.

*[overstay their welcome]: 滞留过久
*[pay slips]: 工资单
*[strictures]: 苛评；非难
*[asylum]: 收容所，救济院
*[rise]: 事物自己的上升，raise 是把事物上升
*[gumming up]: 把事情搞糟；

Governments can take three steps to ease the burden of visas without simply throwing borders open to all-comers. 
The first is to slash the length of their forms. Britain, a grave offender when it comes to high fees and piles of 
paperwork, requires visa applicants to fill in a ten-page form, provide a list of every foreign trip over the past 
decade and declare that they have never incited terrorism to boot. This is absurd. Schengen-area[^1] bureaucrats in 
continental Europe manage to screen visitors in just two pages. America’s visa-waiver programme allows citizens of 
28 countries to visit by filling out a simple online form with basic personal information.

*[grave]: 严重
*[offender]: 犯罪分子
*[piles of]: 成堆
*[incited]: 煽动
*[terrorism]: 恐怖主义
*[absurd]: 荒诞
*[Schengen-area]: 申根区
*[continental Europe]: 欧洲大陆，continental 大陆
*[bureaucrats]: 官僚，官吏
*[visa-waiver]: 免签证， waiver 弃权，免除

Second, government departments need to get better at sharing that information, both within borders and across them. 
Most big receiving countries now demand biometric data such as fingerprints and retinal scans. Many also require 
“advance passenger information” before a traveller is allowed to board an aeroplane. Cross-checking these data 
against intelligence and criminal databases will usually obviate the need for lengthy inquisitions.

*[biometric]: 生物计量的
*[retinal]: 视网膜的
*[aeroplane]: 飞机（等于airplane）
*[obviate]: 排除；避免；
*[inquisitions]: 调查；宗教法庭；审讯
*[intelligence]: 情报机关；

Usually, but not always. Countries will want to investigate some applicants in greater detail. So the third step 
is to grant longer visas to those people who have easily cleared the necessary hurdles. America routinely grants 
ten-year visas; Europe routinely grants ten-day ones. That means travellers to the Schengen area must repeatedly 
prove their good intentions, leading to more otiose paperwork, and fewer visits. Necessary as they are, visas 
need not be so evil.

*[hurdles]:障碍；跨栏；
*[otiose]: 没有用的；不必要的；
