__The Republican candidates’ tax plans are welcome for their detail, but not their contents__

A MONTH before the first primary contest in Iowa, the Republican race is more warlike than wonkish. Yet the candidates have 
found time to write sometimes intricate plans to reform America’s taxes (see article). Though no one blueprint will become 
law, if America chooses a Republican president, he may well have a Republican Congress to work with. At that point, the 
winner’s tax plan will seem less like a campaign gimmick and more like a promise to be kept.

Republicans are right to seek to reform America’s incoherent, tangled-up tax system. America’s corporate tax is a toxic 
combination of a high rate—the highest in the OECD—and a series of complex distortions, which encourage bad behaviour such 
as gorging on debt and stashing cash in foreign subsidiaries. Republicans rightly want to cut the rate and put an end to 
most of the distortions. Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush would also let businesses deduct the cost of their investments from their 
taxes immediately, rather than as their assets deteriorate and lose value. This would encourage investment and boost economic 
growth.

The candidates have interesting ideas for helping low earners, too. Mr Bush and Donald Trump want to raise the standard 
deduction (the amount Americans can earn before paying income tax). That would be a simple way to encourage work and to 
help low- and middle-income households: a similar policy has proved a success in Britain. Mr Bush would also double the 
earned-income tax credit, a wage top-up for low-earners, for childless workers. Mr Rubio wants to replace the standard 
deduction with a universal payment to those in work, which would help even those who earn too little to benefit from an 
increased tax allowance. 

These ideas, though, are mere footnotes to the plans’ central chapters: huge tax cuts for high earners. At 39.6%, America’s 
top federal income-tax rate is hardly high by global standards. Yet the candidates are racing to see who can promise to cut 
it most. Mr Bush aims for 28%; Mr Trump 25%. Ted Cruz wants to replace income tax entirely with a 10% flat tax and a 
value-added tax. Mr Rubio, whose promise of a 35% top rate seems timid by comparison, serves up largesse elsewhere by promising 
to abolish levies on capital gains and dividends.

The first problem with these schemes is their cost. On today’s growth forecasts, even Mr Bush’s relatively moderate plan would 
reduce revenues by $715 billion, or 13.5%, a year by 2026—more than the projected national defence budget. Paying for Mr Trump’s 
plan with reduced day-to-day spending (as opposed to mandatory spending on things like pensions and health care) would require 
cutting budgets by a staggering 82%.

The candidates claim that tax cuts will spur the economy, filling the government’s coffers with new revenue. But the pace of any 
economic acceleration is uncertain. The evidence that income-tax cuts for high earners boost growth is thin at best. Predictions 
that tax cuts in the early 2000s would cause enough growth to pay for themselves look foolish today.

This is no time to be taking chances with America’s budget. Retiring baby-boomers are increasing the cost of providing pensions 
and health care for the old. There is no appetite among Republicans for defence cuts, and other day-to-day spending has already 
been cut by 22% in real terms since 2010. If tax cuts were paid for with more borrowing rather than lower spending, they would 
end up as deadweight for the economy rather than as fuel.

The plans would also greatly exacerbate inequality, which has increased in the 15 years since George W. Bush cut taxes for high 
earners. Under Mr Trump’s plan, for instance, the top 1% of earners would receive a windfall worth 18% of their after-tax income. 
Middle-earners have to settle for a 5% boost; the bottom fifth, just 1%. This belies Mr Trump’s claim to champion the cause of 
ordinary working people. The other plans are little better; Mr Rubio’s plan is probably more generous at the bottom than at the 
top, but he gives middle-income Americans little to cheer about.

The Republicans have spent much of Barack Obama’s presidency denouncing debt and deficits. Yet their proposals to introduce 
unaffordable tax cuts for the rich would send both ballooning. So long as such schemes are a prerequisite for winning the 
Republican nomination, a party that prides itself on economic management will lack a credible policy.
