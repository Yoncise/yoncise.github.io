A MONTH before the first primary contest in Iowa, the Republican race is more warlike than wonkish[^wonkish]. Yet the candidates have 
found time to write sometimes intricate plans to reform America’s taxes. Though no one blueprint will become 
law, if America chooses a Republican president, he may well have a Republican Congress to work with. At that point, the 
winner’s tax plan will seem less like a campaign gimmick and more like a promise to be kept.

*[Iowa]: |ˈaɪəʊə| 艾奥瓦州
*[warlike]: 好战的
*[wonkish]: 学究气的, wonk: 书呆子
*[intricate]: |ˈɪntrɪkət| 错综复杂的
*[gimmick]: |ˈgɪmɪk| 花招

[^wonkish]: 形容词或者名词后面加 -ish，除非是国名地名专指语言或者国民以外，其余就是 大概，一些，左右，的意思。具体是哪个，根据语境来判断。

Republicans are right to seek to reform America’s incoherent, tangled-up tax system. America’s corporate tax is a toxic 
combination of a high rate—the highest in the OECD—and a series of complex distortions, which encourage bad behaviour such 
as gorging on debt and stashing cash in foreign subsidiaries. Republicans rightly want to cut the rate and put an end to 
most of the distortions. Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush would also let businesses deduct the cost of their investments from their 
taxes immediately, rather than as their assets deteriorate and lose value. This would encourage investment and boost economic 
growth.

*[incoherent]: |ˌɪŋkəʊˈhɪərənt| 不连贯的, 无条理的
*[tangled-up]: 缠成一团
*[toxic]: |ˈtɒksɪk| 不良的, 有毒的
*[distortions]: |dɪˈstɔːʃ(ə)n| 变形, 歪曲
*[gorging]: |gɔːdʒ| 狼吞虎咽, 咽喉
*[stashing]: 藏匿
*[subsidiaries]: |səbˈsɪdɪəri, American -dɪeri| 子公司
*[deduct]: 扣除
*[assets]: |ˈæset| 资产
*[deteriorate]: |dɪˈtɪərɪəreɪt| 磨损

The candidates have interesting ideas for helping low earners, too. Mr Bush and Donald Trump want to raise the standard 
deduction (the amount Americans can earn before paying income tax). That would be a simple way to encourage work and to 
help low- and middle-income households: a similar policy has proved a success in Britain. Mr Bush would also double the 
earned-income tax credit, a wage top-up for low-earners, for childless workers. Mr Rubio wants to replace the standard 
deduction with a universal payment to those in work, which would help even those who earn too little to benefit from an 
increased tax allowance. 

*[households]: 家庭
*[tax credit]: 税收抵免
*[allowance]: |əˈlaʊəns| 免税额; 补贴

These ideas, though, are mere footnotes to the plans’ central chapters: huge tax cuts for high earners. At 39.6%, America’s 
top federal income-tax rate is hardly high by global standards. Yet the candidates are racing to see who can promise to cut 
it most. Mr Bush aims for 28%; Mr Trump 25%. Ted Cruz wants to replace income tax entirely with a 10% flat tax and a 
value-added tax. Mr Rubio, whose promise of a 35% top rate seems timid by comparison, serves up largesse elsewhere by promising 
to abolish levies on capital gains and dividends.

*[hardly high]: 不高
*[timid]: 胆怯的
*[serves up]: |sɜːv| 提供
*[largesse]: |lɑːˈdʒes| 慷慨解囊
*[abolish]: |əˈbɒlɪʃ| 废除
*[levies]: |ˈlevi| 税
*[capital gains]: 资本收益
*[dividends]: |ˈdɪvɪdend| 股息, 意外收获

The first problem with these schemes is their cost. On today’s growth forecasts, even Mr Bush’s relatively moderate plan would 
reduce revenues by $715 billion, or 13.5%, a year by 2026—more than the projected national defence budget. Paying for Mr Trump’s 
plan with reduced day-to-day spending (as opposed to mandatory spending on things like pensions and health care) would require 
cutting budgets by a staggering 82%.

*[schemes]: |skiːm| 方案
*[forecasts]: 预测
*[moderate]: |ˈmɒdərət| 中等的 温和的
*[projected]: 计划中的
*[defence]: 保卫
*[mandatory]: 强制的, 法定的
*[staggering]: |ˈstægərɪŋ| 令人难以相信的

The candidates claim that tax cuts will spur the economy, filling the government’s coffers with new revenue. But the pace of any 
economic acceleration is uncertain. The evidence that income-tax cuts for high earners boost growth is thin at best. Predictions 
that tax cuts in the early 2000s would cause enough growth to pay for themselves look foolish today.

*[spur]: |spɜː(r)| 激励 
*[coffers]: 国库; 保险柜
*[pace]: 速度
*[acceleration]: |əkˌseləˈreɪʃn| 加速

This is no time to be taking chances with America’s budget. Retiring baby-boomers are increasing the cost of providing pensions 
and health care for the old. There is no appetite among Republicans for defence cuts, and other day-to-day spending has already 
been cut by 22% in real terms since 2010. If tax cuts were paid for with more borrowing rather than lower spending, they would 
end up as deadweight for the economy rather than as fuel.

*[baby-boomers]: 生育高峰儿 [指20世纪50年代生育高峰期出生的人]
*[deadweight]: 重负

The plans would also greatly exacerbate inequality, which has increased in the 15 years since George W. Bush cut taxes for high 
earners. Under Mr Trump’s plan, for instance, the top 1% of earners would receive a windfall worth 18% of their after-tax income. 
Middle-earners have to settle for a 5% boost; the bottom fifth, just 1%. This belies Mr Trump’s claim to champion the cause of 
ordinary working people. The other plans are little better; Mr Rubio’s plan is probably more generous at the bottom than at the 
top, but he gives middle-income Americans little to cheer about.

*[exacerbate]: |ɪgˈzæsəbeɪt| 使…恶化
*[windfall]: 风吹落的果实, 意外之财
*[settle for]: 勉强接受
*[boost]: 增长
*[belies]: 证明…是错误的
*[champion]: 支持
*[cause]: 事业

The Republicans have spent much of Barack Obama’s presidency denouncing debt and deficits. Yet their proposals to introduce 
unaffordable tax cuts for the rich would send both ballooning. So long as such schemes are a prerequisite for winning the 
Republican nomination, a party that prides itself on economic management will lack a credible policy.

*[presidency]: 总统的任期
*[denouncing]: |dɪˈnaʊns| 谴责
*[proposals]: |prəˈpəʊzl| 提议; 求婚
*[ballooning]: 暴涨
*[prerequisite]: |ˌpriːˈrekwɪzɪt| 先决条件
*[nomination]: 提名
*[credible]: 可行的
