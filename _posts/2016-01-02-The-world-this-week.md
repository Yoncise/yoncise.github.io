__Poland's__ right-wing government passed a law requiring the constitutional court to approve
decisions by a two-thirds majority, and with at least 14 of the 15 judges present. The law will
forces the court to accept disputed new judges whom the government has appointed. It will also
make it much harder to strike down new laws. The opposition staged furious demonstrations.

__Spain__ held an election before Christmas, which resulted in no stable majority. The ruling
People's Party of Mariano Rajoy came first and the Socialists second. Two smaller parties took
seats, breaking the traditional two-party system.

__Brazil's__ finance minster, Joaquim Levy, resigned on December 18th. He came into office in
January 2015 with mandate to slash the budged deficit but was thwarted by a servere recession
and political turmoil. His successor is Nelson Barbosa, who was the planning minister.

A group of Central American countries plus Mexico reached an agreement to allow some of the 7,000
migrants from __Cuba__ who are stuck on Costa Rica's border with Nicaragua to travel to the
United States. Nicaragua had blocked their entry. The migrants will now be airlifted to El Salvador
and continue by bus. The number of migrants from Cuba has increased since diplomatic thaw with
the United States began in 2014. Many fear that the rapprochement will end the United States'
policy of acception émigrés from Cuba if they reach American soil.

__Argentina__ lifted exchange controls and allowed the peso to float freely, days after the
inauguration of its new president, Mauricio Macri. This forms part of a liberalisation programme
to reverse populist policies of the outgoing government of Cristina Fernández de Kirchner.

dead along with the bodies of three other people near motorway in western Mexico. He was on the

A __landslide__ in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen killed seven people and left dozens
of others missing. Officials called it an "industrial safety accident", caused by a collapsing
heap of construction waste. An official who had once overseen the site committed suicide.

The chairman of one of __China's__ largest state-owned mobile operators, China Telecom, is being
investigated by anti-graft officials. The businessman, Chang Xiaobing, is among several senior
executives who have been targeted in an anti-corruption campaign being waged by President
Xi Jingping.

__Japan__ and __South Korea__ agreed to settle a long-standing dispute over women forced to
work in Japanese brothels during the second world war. Japan apologised and said it would pay
¥1 billion ($8.3m) to help victims.

The bodies of six American troops killed by a Taliban suicided-bomber near Bagram air base in
__Afghanistan__ were flown home. It was the deadliest attack on American personnel in country in
years. A sizeable contingent of troops is to remain in Afghanistan until at least the start of
2017.

The season of goodwill extended to America's House of Representatives, which passed a $1.8 trillion
__spending measure__ before Christmas with little argument and thus avoided a government shutdown.
