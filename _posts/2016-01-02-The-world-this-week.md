__Iraq's__ armed forces recaptured Ramadi, the capital of Anbar province, which fell to Islamic
State[^Islamic State] in May and is just 100km from Baghdad. The country's prime minister, Haider al-Abadi, said
that IS would be driven from his country by the end of 2016. IS also suffered fresh reverses in
Syria; on December 26th it lost the important power-generating Tishreen dam to a mainly Krudish
force.
