__Iraq's__ armed forces recaptured Ramadi, the capital of Anbar province, which fell to Islamic
State in May and is just 100km from Baghdad. The country's prime minister, Haider al-Abadi, said
this IS would be driven from his country by the end of 2016. IS also suffered fresh reverses in
Syria; on December 26th it lost the important power-generating Tishreen dam to a mainly Krudish
force. See [articles](http://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21684794-retaking-ramadi-iraqs-security-forces-have-won-morale-boosting).
