AT THE start of 2016 Brazil should be in an exuberant mood. Rio de Janeiro is to host South 
America’s first Olympic games in August, giving Brazilians a chance to embark on what they 
do best: throwing a really spectacular party. Instead, Brazil faces political and economic 
disaster.

On December 16th Fitch became the second of the three big credit-rating agencies to downgrade 
Brazil’s debt to junk status. Days later Joaquim Levy, the finance minister appointed by the 
president, Dilma Rousseff, to stabilise the public finances, quit in despair after less than 
a year in the job. Brazil’s economy is predicted to shrink by 2.5-3% in 2016, not much less 
than it did in 2015. Even oil-rich, sanction-racked Russia stands to do better. At the same 
time, Brazil’s governing coalition has been discredited by a gargantuan bribery scandal surrounding 
Petrobras, a state-controlled oil company. And Ms Rousseff, accused of hiding the size of the 
budget deficit, faces impeachment proceedings in Congress.

As the B in BRICS, Brazil is supposed to be in the vanguard of fast-growing emerging economies. 
Instead it faces political dysfunction and perhaps a return to rampant inflation. Only hard 
choices can put Brazil back on course. Just now, Ms Rousseff does not seem to have the stomach 
for them.

Brazil’s suffering, like that of other emerging economies, stems partly from the fall in global 
commodity prices. But Ms Rousseff and her left-wing Workers’ Party (PT) have made a bad situation 
much worse. During her first term, in 2011-14, she spent extravagantly and unwisely on higher 
pensions and unproductive tax breaks for favoured industries. The fiscal deficit swelled from 
2% of GDP in 2010 to 10% in 2015.

Brazil’s crisis managers do not have the luxury of waiting for better times to begin reform. 
At 70% of GDP, public debt is worryingly large for a middle-income country and rising fast. 
Because of high interest rates, the cost of servicing it is a crushing 7% of GDP. The Central 
Bank cannot easily use monetary policy to fight inflation, currently 10.5%, as higher rates 
risk destabilising the public finances even more by adding to the interest bill. Brazil therefore 
has little choice but to raise taxes and cut spending.

Mr Levy made a game attempt to renovate the building while putting out the fire. He trimmed 
discretionary spending by a record 70 billion reais ($18 billion) in 2015 and tightened 
eligibility for unemployment insurance. But it was not enough. The recession dragged down 
tax revenues. Ms Rousseff gave her finance minister only lukewarm support and the PT was hostile 
towards him. The opposition, intent on ousting the president, was in no mood to co-operate.

Although he was a senior treasury official during Ms Rousseff’s disastrous first term, Nelson 
Barbosa may be able to accomplish more as finance minister. He has political support within 
the PT. He also has bargaining power, because Ms Rousseff cannot afford to lose another finance 
minister. One early test will be whether Mr Barbosa persuades a recalcitrant Congress to reinstate 
an unpopular financial-transactions tax.

A central target should be pensions. The minimum benefit is the same as the minimum wage, which 
has risen by nearly 90% in real terms over the past decade. Women typically retire when they are 
50 and men stop work at 55, nearly a decade earlier than the average in the OECD (a club of mostly 
rich countries). Brazil’s government pays almost 12% of GDP to pensioners, a bigger share than 
older, richer Japan.

If Brazil is to fulfil its promise, much, much more is needed. A typical manufacturing firm spends 
2,600 hours a year complying with the country’s ungainly tax code; the Latin American average is 
356. Labour laws modelled on those of Mussolini make it expensive for firms to fire even incompetent 
employees. Brazil has shielded its firms from international competition. That is one reason why, 
among 41 countries whose performance was measured by the OECD, its manufacturing productivity is the 
fourth-lowest.

To reform work and pensions, Ms Rousseff must face up to problems that have been decades in the 
making. Some 90% of public spending is protected from cuts, partly by the constitution which, in 1988, 
celebrated the end of military rule by enshrining generous job protection and state benefits. Because 
it is so hard to reform, Brazil’s public sector rivals European welfare states for size but emerging 
ones for inefficiency. Long a drain on economic vitality, Brazil’s overbearing state is now a chief 
cause of the fiscal crisis.

Overcoming such deep-rooted practices would be hard for any government. In Brazil it is made all the 
harder by a daft political system, which favours party fragmentation and vote-buying and attracts 
political mercenaries who have little commitment either to party or to programme. The threshold for 
a party to enter the lower house of Congress is low; today 28 are represented, adding to the legislative 
gridlock. Congressmen represent entire states, some as populous as neighbouring Latin American countries, 
which makes campaigning ruinously expensive—one reason why politicians skimmed off huge amounts of money 
from Petrobras.

It is therefore hard, despite Mr Barbosa’s advantages, to feel optimistic about the prospects for deep 
reform. Voters hold politicians in contempt. The opposition is bent on impeaching Ms Rousseff, a misguided 
battle that could dominate the political agenda for months. The PT has no appetite for austerity. Achieving
the three-fifths support in both houses of Congress needed for constitutional reforms will be a tall order.

__Reckless Rousseff__

And if Ms Rousseff fails to bring about change? Most of Brazil’s borrowing is in local currency, which makes 
default unlikely. Instead, the country may end up inflating away its debts. Brazil’s achievement has been to 
lift tens of millions of people out of rag-and-flip-flop poverty. Recession will halt that, or even begin to 
reverse it. The hope is that Brazil, which has achieved hard-won economic and democratic stability, does not 
lapse once again into chronic mismanagement and turmoil.
