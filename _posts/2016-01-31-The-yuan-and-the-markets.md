__Strains on the currency suggest that something is very wrong with China’s politics__

“WHAT if we could just be China for a day?” mused Thomas Friedman, an American columnist, in 2010. “…We could actually, 
you know, authorise the right solutions.” Five years on, few are so ready to sing the praises of China’s technocrats. 
Global markets have fallen by 7.1% since January 1st, their worst start to the year since at least 1970. A large part 
of the problem is China’s management of its economy.

For well over a decade, China has been the engine of global growth. But the blistering pace of economic expansion has 
slowed. The stockmarket has been in turmoil, again. Although share prices in China matter little to the real economy, 
seesawing stocks feed fears among investors that the Communist Party does not have the wisdom to manage the move from 
Mao to market. The rest of the world looks at the debts and growing labour unrest inside China, and it 
shudders. Nowhere are those worries more apparent—or more consequential—than in the handling of its currency, the yuan.

*[blistering]: |ˈblɪstərɪŋ| 极快的
*[seesawing]: change rapidly and repeatedly from one position, situation, or condition to another and back again
*[unrest]: 动乱
*[shudders]: |ˈʃʌdə| 颤抖
*[consequential]: 有影响力的

China’s economy is not on the verge of collapse. Next week the government will announce last year’s rate of economic 
growth. It is likely to be close to 7%. That figure may be an overestimate, but it is not entirely divorced from reality. 
Nevertheless, demand is slowing, inflation is uncomfortably low and debts are rising. The bullish case for China depends 
partly upon the belief that the government can always lean against the slowdown by stimulating consumption and investment 
with looser monetary policy—just as in any normal economy.

*[verge]: be on the verge of 接近于
*[bullish]: 看涨的
*[lean]: 斜靠
*[monetary]: |ˈmʌnɪt(ə)ri| 货币的


Yet China is not normal. It is caught in a dangerous no-man’s-land between the market and state control. And the yuan is 
the prime example of what a perilous place this is. After a series of mini-steps towards liberalisation, China has a 
semi-fixed currency and semi-porous capital controls. Partly because a stronger dollar has been dragging up the yuan, the 
People’s Bank of China (PBOC) has tried to abandon its loose peg against the greenback since August; but it is still 
targeting a basket of currencies[^a-basket-of-currencies]. A gradual loosening of capital controls means savers have plenty of ways to get their 
money out.

*[perilous]: |ˈperələs| 危险的
*[porous]: |ˈpɔːrəs| 多孔的
*[peg]: 钩子
*[greenback]: 美钞

[^a-basket-of-currencies]: A currency basket is a portfolio of selected currencies with different weightings.

A weakening economy, a quasi-fixed exchange rate and more porous capital controls are a volatile combination. Looser 
monetary policy would boost demand. But it would also weaken the currency; and that prospect is already prompting savers 
to shovel their money offshore.

*[quasi-fixed]: |ˈkweɪzaɪ,ˈkwɑːzi| 准固定的; quasi, 准的
*[volatile]: |ˈvɒlətaɪl, American -tl| 不稳定的; 易挥发的
*[savers]: 储户 
*[prompting]: |ˈprɒm(p)tɪŋ| 敦促, 提醒
*[shovel]: |ˈʃʌvl| 铲入; 铁铲
*[offshore]: |ˌɒfˈʃɔː(r), American ˌɔːf-| 境外的

In the last six months of 2015 capital left China at an annualised rate of about $1 trillion. The persistent gap between 
the official value of the yuan and its price in offshore markets suggests investors expect the government to allow the 
currency to fall even further in future. And, despite a record trade surplus of $595 billion in 2015, there are good 
reasons for it to do so, at least against the dollar, which is still being propelled upwards by tighter monetary policy 
in America.

*[trade surplus]: |ˈsɜːpləs| 贸易顺差
*[propelled]: |prəˈpel| 推进
*[savers]: 储户 

The problem is that the expectation of depreciation risks becoming a self-fulfilling loss of confidence. That is a risk 
even for a country with foreign-exchange reserves of more than $3 trillion. A sharply weaker currency is also a threat 
to China’s companies, which have taken on $10 trillion of debt in the past eight years, roughly a tenth of it in dollars. 
Either those companies will fail, or China’s state-owned banks will allow them to limp on. Neither is good for growth.

*[depreciation]: |dɪˌpriːʃɪˈeɪʃn| 贬值
*[self-fulfilling]: 实现自己抱负的，自我实现的
*[foreign-exchange]: 外汇
*[limp]: 跛行

The government has reacted by trying to rig markets. The PBOC has squeezed the fledgling offshore market in Hong Kong by 
buying up yuan so zealously that the overnight interest rate spiked on January 12th at 67%. Likewise, in the stockmarket 
it has instructed the “national team” of state funds to stick to the policy of buying and holding shares.

*[rig]: 暗箱操纵
*[squeezed]: |skwiːz| 挤
*[fledgling]: |ˈfledʒlɪŋ| 初出茅庐的人
*[zealously]: |ˈzeləsli| 热情的
*[spiked]: |spaɪk| 钉住; 尖状物
*[stick to]: 坚持做, 继续使用

__One step back, two forwards__

Yet such measures do nothing to resolve a fundamental tension. On the one hand, the state understands that the lack of 
financial options for Chinese savers is unpopular, wasteful and bad for the economy. On the other, it is threatened by 
the ructions that liberalisation creates. For Xi Jinping, the president, now in his fourth year in charge, that dilemma 
seems to crop up time and again. He needs middle-class support, but feels threatened by the capacity of 
the middle class to make trouble. He wants state-owned enterprises to become more efficient, but also for them to give 
jobs to the soldiers he is booting out of the People’s Liberation Army. He wants to “cage power” by 
strengthening the rule of law and by invoking the constitution, yet he is overseeing a vicious clampdown on dissent and 
free speech.

*[options]: 期权
*[ructions]: |ˈrʌkʃnz| 争吵
*[dilemma]: |daɪˈlemə,dɪ-| 窘境
*[crop up]: 突然出现
*[time and again]: 屡次；常常
*[invoking]: 援引, 唤起 
*[overseeing]: 监督, 监视
*[vicious]: |ˈvɪʃəs| 残暴的, 猛烈的
*[clampdown]: |ˈklampdaʊn| 严厉打击
*[dissent]: |dɪˈsent| 异议


It is easy to say so now, but China should have cleaned up its financial system and freed its exchange rate when money was 
still flowing in. Now that the economy is slowing, debt has piled up and the dollar is strong, it has no painless way out.

A sharp devaluation would wrong-foot speculators. But it would also cause mayhem in China and export its deflationary 
pressures. The poison would spread across Asia and into rich countries. And because interest rates are low and many 
governments indebted, the world is ill-equipped to cope.

*[devaluation]: 贬值
*[wrong-foot]: 使措手不及
*[speculators]: |ˈspekjʊleɪtə(r)| 投机者
*[mayhem]: |ˈmeɪhem| 骚乱
*[deflationary]: |ˌdiːˈfleɪʃənəri, American -neri| 通货紧缩的
*[indebted]: |ɪnˈdetɪd| 欠债的
*[cope]: |kəʊp| 应付, 承受

Better would be for China to strengthen capital controls temporarily and at the same time to stop stage-managing the yuan’s 
value. That would be a loss of face for China, because the IMF only recently marked the yuan’s progress towards convertibility 
by including it in the basket of currencies that make up its Special Drawing Rights[^SDR]. But it would let the country prepare its 
financial institutions for currency volatility, not least by starting to scrub their balance-sheets, before flinging their 
doors open to destabilising flows. Mr Xi could embrace more complete convertibility later, when they were less vulnerable.

*[stage-managing]: 精心安排
*[convertibility]: |kənˌvɜːtəˈbɪləti| 可转换性, 可兑换性
*[Special Drawing Rights]: 特别提款权
*[scrub]: |skrʌb| 擦洗
*[balance-sheets]: 自残负债表
*[flinging]: |flɪŋ| 扔
*[embrace]: |ɪmˈbreɪs| 拥抱

One reason the PBOC is rushing towards convertibility, despite the risks, is that it feels that it must seize the chance 
while it has Mr Xi’s blessing. But better to retreat temporarily on one front than to trigger a global panic. That might also 
lead to some clearer thinking. There is a contradiction between liberalisation and party control, between giving markets their 
say and silencing them when their message is unwelcome. When the time is right, China’s leaders must choose the markets.

*[seize]: |siːz| 抓住
*[blessing]: |ˈblesɪŋ| 同意; 祈神赐福
*[retreat]: 撤退
*[contradiction]: |ˌkɒntrəˈdɪkʃn| 矛盾
